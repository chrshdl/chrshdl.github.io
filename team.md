Christian Hedel holds a computer science degree from Freie Universität Berlin with specialization in Machine Learning.

He is a former Volkswagen AG software engineer with more than a decade of experience delivering production automotive software across infotainment, voice systems, and applied machine learning. There, he implemented speech recognition systems and later served as the Functional Owner for Amazon Alexa Auto, owning the feature end to end—from requirements and system behavior to integration, release, and field issue analysis.

Earlier in his career, he spent several years at IAV shipping series-production software for the MIB infotainment platform, including Speech-Dialog and App-Connect. He also led integration efforts for Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, and Baidu CarLife, alongside project reporting and team leadership.
